She was birthed to her parents on March 22nd, 2007. Had she survived, she would have been 16 years old now.</p><p>Unfortunately, Leyah never got to meet her family as her birth was complicated. She died a few hours after her birth, and this left the family devastated, especially her mother, who was looking forward to holding her baby girl and watching her grow into a fine young woman. Leyah’s rapper father, T.I., was also distraught and shocked to hear that his baby died.</p><p>Leyah Amore Harris might no longer be breathing in this world following her unfortunate demise, but millions of people do know about her as one of T.I.’s children. For being the daughter of a music power couple, a lot of audiences around the world knew about her tragic life, which ended within hours. She is T.I.’s fifth child.</p><h3><strong>Major Philant Harris</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> May 16, 2008</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 15 Years Old</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Tameka Dianne Cottle Harris</li><li><strong>Instagram:</strong> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@majorpharris</a></li></ul><p>Major Philant Harris is T.I.’s fourth son and fifth child. He was born on May 16, 2008, in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, to T.I. and his wife Tiny. He is T.I. and Tiny’s third child together, and they had him two years before they officially got married in 2010.</p><p>Just like his siblings, Major has also appeared on the Television show T.I. and Tiny: The Family Hustle, where he left a lasting impression in the hearts of many that watched the show before it ended on May 29, 2017. Fans of the show are looking forward to when he would be gracing their screens again with his amazing talent as an actor or reality tv star. Going by the fact that a good number of his family members are entertainers, there is no doubt that Major Philant is likely going to follow in the same career line when he comes of age.</p><p>Philant Harris is being raised in his hometown of Atlanta by his famous parents, along with his six other siblings and half-siblings. Coming from a prestigious background, he is well-educated. He graduated from Elementary High School in May of 2018 and has gone ahead to further his education in a school that is unknown to any source at the moment.</p><p>Philant is the one exception among all of T.I.’s children because he is not yet on any specific career path yet. He does have an active Instagram account that is being managed by his parents and family until he is old enough to handle things for himself. His handle has over 184k followers.</p><h3><strong>Heiress Diana Harris is the Youngest Among T.I’s Children</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> March 26, 2016</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 7 Years Old</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Tameka Dianne Cottle Harris</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Social Media Influencer, Model, and YouTuber</li><li><strong>Instagram:</strong> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@heiressdharris</a></li></ul><p>The last of T.I.’s children is Heiress Diana Harris. She is T.I. and R&B singer Tameka Harris’ third child and first daughter. She was born on March 26, 2016, in Georgia, United States of America. Aside from her famous background, Heiress has also garnered lots of fans and followers on her social media accounts. She is active on Instagram under the username @heiressdharris, with 513k followers. She also showcases her fashionista lifestyle and family photos on the platform.</p><p>Heiress also has a YouTube channel called ‘Heiress Does It All,’ where she primarily uploads family vlogs. Her parents have also been featured on her YouTube channel. One of the most popular videos on her YouTube channel is “MEET MY VALENTINE,” in which she features her father, who is her first Valentine.</p><p>She might be young and still a minor, but unlike her brother, she is also an entrepreneur, having launched The Royal Collection by Heiress Harris with Piggy Paint, an all-natural children’s nail polish line. She also expressed an interest in acting in 2019 and landed her first acting role in one audition. She is currently enrolled in a private school in her hometown.</p><p>As she is still a young child, her Instagram account is being run and monitored by her mother. Presently, she has a whole lot of interesting posts on her Instagram page, including gorgeous-looking pictures from home and scenic places.</p><p>From the above, it is rather clear that Heiress Diana Harris has already established income sources totally independent of her father’s wealth. From the promotions she runs, the brands she influences, and her modeling efforts, her current net worth, according to sources, is estimated to be above $700k.</p><p>Besides her well-known major sources of income, Heiress also rakes in a tidy sum from her youtube channel. Since she is young and still very active, fans expect some changes when she eventually starts managing her channels for herself, hence her net worth is likely going to shoot up in the coming years.</p><h3><strong>Zonnique Pullins is T.I’s Step-daughter</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> March 20th, 1996</li><li><strong>Age: </strong>27 Years Old</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Tameka Harris</li><li><strong>Father:</strong> Zonnie ‘Zebo’ Pullins</li><li><strong>Occupation: </strong>Television Personality and Singer</li><li><strong>Instagram:</strong> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@zonniquejailee</a></li></ul><p>Zonnique Pullins is fondly called Nique Nique by her family. She is the daughter of Tameka Harris and stepdaughter to rapper T.I. She was born on March 20th, 1996, to Tameka Cottle and her ex-boyfriend Zonnie ‘Zebo’ Pullins. Zonnique, better known by her stage name Miss Star, followed in her mother’s footsteps and is a well-known R&B performer and a television personality.</p><p>She makes up one-third of the girl group OMG Girlz together with Bahja Rodriguez and Breaunna Womack. She has also released music on her own as a solo artist. One of her well-known songs is “Pretty Hustle.” She further became known to reality tv fans with her appearance and has also advanced in the 2017 season of the reality television program Growing Up Hip Hop: Atlanta.</p><p>At 27, the rapper has been very open about her love life. According to sources, she dated rapper Zoey Zuko for some time before they called it quits and went their separate ways. She found love again and began dating fellow rapper Bandhunta Izzy in December 2020. A year later, in 2021, the lovebirds welcomed their first child together, a daughter whose face they have kept concealed.</p><p>In an interview after the birth of her daughter, Zonnique reflected on the kind of relationship she wants to have with her daughter based on the nonexistent one she had with her own mother. She discussed how T.I. and Tiny’s marriage negatively impacted her mother-daughter relationship with Tiny. This notwithstanding, she states that it felt great to be counted amongst T.I.’s children because he was an awesome stepfather, even though she did not like how he seemed to be joined at the hip with Tiny.</p><p>From her work with OMG Girlz, her solo career, and her reality tv career, Zonnique Pullins’s net worth has been estimated to be around $500k. Considering how active she has been with releases and collaborations, her net worth is bound to increase in the coming years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqmsdNmq2aho2KvrbHNnZydZZaWuqq42Gamn2VnYrCptcudqZ6mXZu%2FsLmMpqylrJmluaZ51qiknqZf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./calebcity-phone-number-whatsapp-number-contact-number-mobile.html>&#171;&nbsp;CalebCity Phone Number, WhatsApp Number Contact Number Mobile</a>
