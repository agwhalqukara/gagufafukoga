Today we will explore some more truth about Jeanne Bonnaire-Hurt.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Jeanne Bonnaire-Hurt’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Jeanne Bonnaire-Hurt</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> February 1, 1994</li><li><strong>Jeanne Bonnaire-Hurt’s Age:</strong> 29 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Caucasian</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American/French</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Aquarius</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Jeanne Bonnaire-Hurt’s Parents:</strong> Sandrine Bonnaire (mother), William McChord Hurt (father, deceased)</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Alexander Devon Hurt, Samuel Hurt, Willam Hurt Jr. (half-brothers), Adele Laurant (half-sister)</li><li><strong>Eye Color:</strong> Brown</li><li><strong>Hair Color:</strong> Brown</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being the celebrity child of Sandrine Bonnaire and the recently deceased William Hurt</li></ul><h2><strong>Jeanne Bonnaire-Hurt Was Born in Washington, D.C.</strong></h2><p>Jeanne Bonnaire-Hurt was born on February 1, 1994, and she is currently 29 years old. Jeanne is a white caucasian celebrity kid born in Washington, D.C., United States of America. Her birth sign is Aquarius, and she holds dual citizenship as a result of the different nationalities of her parents.</p><p>Jeanne Hurt is the daughter of a popular French actress, film director, and screenwriter who is known as Sandrine Bonnaire. Jeanne is the product of Sandrine’s affair with the equally famous but now deceased American actor, William McChord Hurt.</p><p>Her parents dated for a while, from the early to mid/late 1990s but broke up a few years after giving birth to Jeanne in 1994. As previously stated, Jeanne was born in Washington, D.C., where she spent the majority of her formative years. However, not much is known about the celebrity child who prefers to keep her affairs, personal or otherwise, away from the curious gaze of the media and the public.</p><p>As a result of this reticence toward the spotlight, there are scarcely any details of her formal educational background on the internet. One can assume that, given her family background, Jeanne Bonnaire-Hurt had the privilege of going through every level of formal education, from creche to college level.</p><p>Without directly speaking to or hearing from Jeanne in matters related to the aforementioned formal education, it would, however, be a much more challenging task to presume which high school she obtained her high school diploma from, which college she acquired a degree from, or which course of study she pursued as a student of the college.</p><p>It is important to reiterate that while it is proven that Jeanne Hurt has other siblings, she is the only child that her parents had over the course of their 5-year relationship. The siblings mentioned above are Jeanne’s half-siblings, three of whom are older than she is.</p><h2><strong>Did Jeanne Bonnaire-Hurt Follow Her Parents’ Career Path?</strong></h2><p>Another end product of the celebrity child’s decision to stay away from the limelight is that the public and the media have no clue about what she does for a living or how she earns a steady income.</p><p>On the other hand, Jeanne’s mother is renowned for having carved out a niche for herself in the entertainment industry as an actress. Born Sandrine Bonnaire on May 31, 1967, in Gannat, Allier, France, the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actress was the seventh of eleven children born to a working-class French couple.</p><p>Sandrine’s parents weren’t well off, and the pressure of having to feed so many mouths, including Sandrine’s, must have been overwhelming. Jeanne’s mother, Sandrine, saw the entertainment industry as her escape from the chaos and ended up becoming an actress, film director, and screenwriter, a really good one at that.</p><p>She made her silver screen debut as a 16-year-old teenager in 1983. Her contribution to the global entertainment community has seen her accrue over two dozen movie and TV series credits to her name throughout her nearly 4-decade career in the industry. She has also picked up several awards in recognition of her splendid works as an actress.</p><p>It also doesn’t hurt that she has a net worth estimated to be around the $2 million mark. It would appear that despite Jeanne’s apparent aversion to the spotlight, it was a place where both her parents thrived and earned their living from. Before his death from prostate cancer complications on March 13, 2022, Jeanne’s father was also a reputable American actor.</p><p>Born William McChord Hurt on March 20, 1950, in Washington, D.C., United States, Jeanne’s late father attended Tuft University and Juilliard before venturing into the movie industry at the age of 27 in 1977. He started as a theater actor before making so many iconic on-screen characters his own.</p><p>For clarity, it is important to note that William Hurt was the actor who played the role of William Marshall in Robin Hood (2010). He also felt right at home as Thaddeus Ross in the various Marvel movies such as Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers: End Game (2019), and Black Widow (2021), amongst many others.</p><p>Jeanne’s father also did enough to earn multiple awards and attained a comfortable level of financial affluence for his celebrated efforts. At the time of his death, the veteran actor was reportedly worth an estimated $20 million.</p><h2><strong>Jeanne Bonnaire-Hurt’s Parents Were Never Married</strong></h2><p>Without being properly informed, it would be a very easy gesture to assume that Jeanne Bonnaire-Hurt’s parents were once married to each other. That assumption, though, couldn’t be farther from the truth because although they were together for five years, Jeanne Bonnaire-Hurt’s parents never exchanged marital vows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/08/william-hurt-died-1.jpg><p>The former couple reportedly met for the first time in 1991 during the filming of the Albert Camus novel The Plague (La Peste). They got to know each other and officially began dating exclusively in 1992. They welcomed Jeanne, their only child as a couple, in 1994.</p><p>The same year, they appeared together in Secrets Shared with a Stranger (1994). Jeanne’s parents went their separate ways when she was around 3 years old in 1997. The reason for their break up has yet to be made public by either party.</p><h2><strong>Is Jeanne Bonnaire-Hurt Married?</strong></h2><p>Jeanne Bonnaire-Hurt’s decision to live her life away from the spotlight also means that the status of her romantic life is unknown at the moment. The celebrity child is not married, and her non-existent social media life means we can’t be too sure of these assumptions.</p><p>Her mother, Sandrine, is divorced. She was married to fellow French screenwriter and actor Guillaume Laurant from 2003 to 2015. That marriage gave Jeanne a younger half-sister named Adele Laurant. Jeanne’s father was also married twice in his life, even though he was involved in several other romantic relationships.</p><p>He was first married to Mary Beth Hurt (née Supinger) from 1971 to 1982, but they didn’t have children together. He was later married to Heidi Henderson from 1989 to 1993. His marriage to Henderson produced two sons, and before his death, William Hurt was a father of three sons and a daughter, four children in all. One of his sons was born from a relationship with a woman named Sandra Jennings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMGzwdOhZJqan6rBbrbEmqWnnV2XvK%2B6wKKpnmWYqr%2B1edKapZ2qmaOybq7Op6WaoaKawG6wwK6eoayVp3w%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./betty-lynn-actress-who-played-thelma-lou-on-the-andy-griffith-show-dies-at-95.html>&#171;&nbsp;Betty Lynn, actress who played Thelma Lou on 'The Andy Griffith Show,' dies at 95</a>
