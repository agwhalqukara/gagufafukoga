Tell us about your brand-new single “Cherry Bomb!” What inspired the song and what do you hope listeners feel when they listen?</strong></p><p><b>AJR: </b>“Hey guys! This is such a fun song, which from the off had a fruity feel to it. When I received the initial beat to write on, it had this light twinkle and zesty vibe. I can normally hear music and feel what the song is about – it kind of speaks to me. I thought it sounded bright and colorful with swag and a sweetness – like a strawberry. To be fair, I am always thinking about strawberries, they are my favorite fruit. I began jotting down lyrics that could metaphorically work but rhyming with strawberry proved a bit challenging. Strawberries turned to any type of berry, and in came the wild cherry. Wild turned into a vision of a girl who is both sweet and sour. She has a striking beauty and a firecracker personality. And so began the rest of the lyrics combined with metaphors – hot temptation, sweet sensation.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>I hope listeners will feel happy and alive when they hear ‘Cherry Bomb’. It is pure pop, full of positivity, and fun lyrics. The song very much celebrates ‘girl power’ in a Spice Girl Brit-pop way. I think the guys can relate to a cherry bomb that may have walked past them. She’s a head turner!”</p><p><b>CS</b>: <strong>You just continue to grow and get better with each release. When you listen to your old songs like “My Crew,” how do you personally feel you’ve grown as an artist?</strong></p><p><b>AJR</b>: “Thank you so much. It’s hard to believe I started on my professional music journey in May of 2020 during lockdown. I was 12 when I recorded ‘My Crew’ and I have released ten songs since. I listen to ‘My Crew’ and hear such a little kid. Lyrically I wasn’t ready to sing about a cherry bomb, I was a tween, so sang about my friends I had been with since day 1 in America. ‘Your Smile’ was about a girls smile and coming to Los Angeles from London. With each single release I have been “growing up”, both mentally, physically and as a recording artist. I’m 14 now and growing each day – my voice and vocals have developed too, and I have become more confident in the studio with my knowledge. I am not a naturally confident person. I am a freshman in a regular school, am a complete book worm, and I love to draw – so music has helped me grow in confidence each song I write and release. At age 12 the thought of performing live on stage panicked me – now I stick on a colorful pair of jeans and love every moment up there!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alexander-James-Rodriguez_-3-819x1024.jpg><p><b>CS</b>: <strong>The music video for “Cherry Bomb” is our favorite! Can you share any fun memories from the set?</strong></p><p><b>AJR: “</b>Wow guys thank you! Originally, we wanted to film ‘Cherry Bomb’ at a school – with lockers and water fountains but schools were about to be re-opened so that option was proving difficult. For hours I sat with my mum scrolling through different filming locations and came across the diner. It was bright, and with dancers and some colorful outfits in mind, we wrote up the storyboard. Every shot you see was part of the initial story.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Some of the highlights was convincing my mum to let me order custom-made <a href=#>Cherry Bomb VANS</a>, and match them with purple and pinks to give off that strawberry / cherry vibe. Also, we created a ‘Cherry Bomb’ placemat menu, with coloring pens so that the cast could be entertained during takes and also could double up as souvenir.</p><p>Working with fellow Brit Marvin Brown (HBO Max: We’re here) with the choreography to ‘Cherry Bomb’, and dancers Isidora Villagra, Jedd Berina, Kaileia Dixon and Mckenzie Cole, and of course Ava Rose our cherry bomb, was a lot of fun. I am so grateful they came on board. They are all AMAZING!</p><p>Here is an exclusive fun fact. The photo on the cover art was taken in March 2021– with no idea of the music video. Purple and pink was all we thought of for the photo. From that photo came the ‘Cherry Bomb’ creative and ultimately the music video released 7 months later. It started with that one photo.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>CS</b>: <strong>Who is your current Celeb Cherry Bomb (Celeb Crush)?</strong></p><p><strong>AJR</strong>: “Gosh! I don’t know. I am so busy with school, homework, creating music, content, and acting gigs I don’t really have time to think of a Cherry Bomb Celeb Crush – but you’ll be the first to know when I do. It’ll be our secret. 😉”</p><p><b>CS: </b><strong>Lastly, what else can fans expect from you for the remainder of the year?</strong></p><p><strong>AJR</strong>: “‘Cherry Bomb’ has just been nominated for a Hollywood Music in Media Award – which is super exciting. That’s new news. I have some live performances coming up in and around California and November 19th I am releasing a fun Holiday song. I hope to tour some high schools early next year and January 14th, 2022, my next single, ‘Alright!’ will be released. Aside from that a whole bunch of homework!”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="g1-beta g1-beta-2nd">What's Your Reaction?</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FEnKmerKNjsLC5jpqjnrCRo7GmvoyjmKado2K%2FsLDRop6unapisrm8y6ibnqtdrLa1tIynnLBlo567qLjEZpqhnaKnxm6uzqaZZqSZqMGmuo4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./coolio-and-lisa-loeb-face-off-in-90s-trivia-game-are-pretty-terrible.html>&#171;&nbsp;Coolio and Lisa Loeb Face Off in '90s Trivia Game, Are Pretty Terrible</a>
