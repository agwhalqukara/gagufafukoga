Bhakta’s judgement and ability to lead were questioned during the campaign after he was twice arrested for drunk driving in 1997 and 2004.&nbsp;Bhakta, after hearing about the arrests, said that he asked for forgiveness and understood the voters and gave them his solemn promise that the same behavior would not happen again.</p><p>Bhakta, who was riding an elephant for ninety minutes along the border with a six-man mariachi group, demonstrated the ease of crossing the United States-Mexico Border on October 10, 2006.&nbsp;Bhakta and the mariachi band did not violate the law by crossing border. They remained on private property in Texas along the Rio Grande.&nbsp;Bhakta claimed that he was inspired by a Mexican man who illegally crossed the Rio Grande.&nbsp;Bhakta used a camera to capture the illegal crossing and was able to get the border officials to detain the man.&nbsp;Bhakta’s campaign received national attention after the demonstration.&nbsp;Bill O’Reilly and Rita Cosby interviewed Bhakta. Glenn Beck and John Gibson also interviewed Bhakta.&nbsp;Bhakta stated, “This isn’t about the poor Mexican immigrant looking for a better future. That’s the real problem.”&nbsp;Bhakta said, “The border security system is a joke. This is a creative and very efficient way to show it.”</p><p>Bhakta also founded the WhistlePig brand of rye whiskey, which was initially launched as a non-distiller producer that bottled Canadian whiskey from the Alberta Premium distillery owned by Fortune Brands in Alberta, Canada. Starting in 2007, he purchased land in Vermont, on which he built a new distillery and aging facility for the brand. The brand was officially launched in 2010.</p><p>Bhakta met Danhee Kim, a Columbia University in 2010, when she was hired as his executive assistant.
