McKeon was born on 4 April 1966, in Westbury, New York State USA, and is an actress, best known for playing the role of Jo Polniaczek in the sitcom “The Facts of Life”. She also played the character Jinny Extead in “The Division”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/150160_3374-1024x681.jpg><h2><span id=The_Riches_of_Nancy_Mckeon>The Riches of Nancy Mckeon</span></h2><p>How rich is Nancy Mckeon? As of early-2019, sources estimate a net worth that is at $6 million, earned largely through a successful career in acting. She’s also appeared in several films and television movies throughout her career, and as she continues her endeavors, it is expected that her wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings>Career Beginnings</span></h2><p>Very little is known about Nancy’s childhood, her family, and her education. It is known that at a young age, she along with her older brother Philip started appearing in commercials, which led to the start of their respective acting <a rel=nofollow href=#>careers</a>. She landed a few soap opera projects including “The Secret Storm”, and “Another World” which was a soap that focused less on the drama of domestic life and more about the interaction between families of various classes and philosophies.</p><p>Eventually, she along with her brother moved to Los Angeles when he was cast for a role in the series “Alice”. Her breakthrough would come in 1979, when she discovered by a casting director during the filming of a Hallmark greetings card advertisement, which led her to be cast in “<a rel=nofollow href=#>The Facts of Life</a>” in which she played the character Jo Polniaczek during the show’s second season. She was introduced to the show after four of its original cast members left, and this would become one of her most notable roles, as she stayed with the show until its cancellation in 1988.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2><span id=Other_Projects_and_The_Division>Other Projects and The Division</span></h2><p>While working for the ABC, she also did voice acting work, mainly voicing cartoon characters for the “ABC Weekend Special”; she is known to have voiced Scruffy in the animated film of the same name based on the book “Scruffy: The Tuesday Dog”. She was then hired by NBC for the sitcom adaptation of “Working Girl”, which starred the then unknown Sandra Bullock. In 1994, McKeon auditioned for the role of Monica Geller on “Friends”, but losing the role to Courtney Cox. When asked about the role, she mentioned that Cox was a good choice for the role, and she can’t imagine anyone else playing the character.</p><p>In 1995, she became the star of the series “Can’t Hurry Love” which was short lived, being cancelled after one season, and her next major project would come in 1998 in “Style & Substance”, starring alongside Jean Smart. In 2001, she played inspector Jinny Exstead in the Lifetime series “<a rel=nofollow href=#>The Division</a>”, a police procedural drama focused on female officers and detectives. Her real life pregnancy was written into the show during the last year of the series.</p><h2><span id=Later_Career>Later Career</span></h2><p>In 2009, Nancy was cast in a recurring role in the Disney Channel Original Series entitled “Sonny with a Chance’, playing the mother of Demi Lovato’s character. The show ran for three seasons, when Lovato decided to leave to focus on other projects, including appearing in various independent films and television movies such as “Love Begins”, “Wild Hearts”, “Comfort and Joy”, and “In My Sister’s Shadow”. She is also known for her portrayal of Tracey Thurman in “A Cry for Help: The Tracey Thurman Story”.</p><p>After a seven year absence from acting projects, it was announced in 2018 that Nancy will compete in the 27th season of the reality dancing competition “Dancing with the Stars”, which saw her paired with professional dancer Valentin Chmerkovskly. The show is the US version of the UK show “Strictly Come Dancing” and consists of numerous celebrities, each paired with a professional dancer, competing in pre-determined dances to gain the judges points as well as audience votes. The couple to receive the lowest votes and points gets eliminated each week until only one pair remains. Nancy and Valentin were the third celebrities eliminated from the show.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>For her personal life, it is known that McKeon married Marc Andurs in 2003, about whom very little is known and they have two children together, now residing in Austin, Texas. She previously dated actor Michael J. Fox for three years after meeting on the set of “High School U.S.A.” During her popularity in “The Facts of Life”, she was allowed to have a private audience with Pope John Paul II, in which she was joined by her parents.</p><p>Her older brother is actor Philip McKeon, who rose to popularity as the son of the title character in the sitcom “Alice”. After the show, he only made periodic acting appearances in projects such as “Sandman” and “Ghoulies IV”, but the siblings appeared in the film “Teresa’s Tattoo” together. While Philip was the one to rise to fame the first of the siblings, it was Nancy who continued to have consistent acting projects transitioning well into adult acting roles. One of the reasons there is very limited information about Nancy is due to the lack of any strong online presence. She does not have accounts on any of the major social media websites. The same can be said for her brother about whom even less information is known, only pictures from his time as a child actor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZlpuuqr7PqKqtZpOkunC6wKeasmWdmLimu81mrqKjmWKvqruMnZiun5ipsrN5waumraCVp3qurdGroJ6cXZuurrXLsmSdmaSeu6h5xZqaratf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./opposite-of-even.html>&#171;&nbsp;Opposite of even</a>
