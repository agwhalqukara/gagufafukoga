Often referred to as “The Genius” — a title bestowed upon him by Frank Sinatra (per <a href=#>The Los Angeles Times)</a> — Charles was born in 1930 and overcame seemingly impossible odds to become one of the most prolific, and influential, <a href=#>musicians</a> of all time.</p><p>Considered by many as the pioneer of the <a href=#>modern soul music genre,</a> Ray Charles’ music has been sampled by everyone from <a href=#>Kanye West</a> (“Gold Digger,” which sampled “I Got A Woman”) to Led Zeppelin (“Your Time Is Gonna Come,” which sampled “I Believe to My Soul”). The biopic about his life, “Ray,” earned <a href=#>Jamie Foxx</a> his first — and to date, his only — Academy Award win. And <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> has named him at No. 10 on the Top 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.</p><p>In short, he is nothing short of a legend. And though his $75 million estate (per <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth)</a> is quite impressive, it is his continued legacy in <a href=#>his twelve children</a> — who were born between 1949 and 1987 — that is, perhaps, the most precious of all.</p><p>Let’s take a look at how the magic of Ray Charles continues to live on, even in the 21st century and beyond.</p><p>Editorial note: The net worth listed in this piece is a speculative estimate drawn from a variety of online sources.</p><h3>Evelyn Robinson</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cms.afrotech.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Evelyn-Robinson_Frazer-Harrison-1200x675.jpg><p>Little is known about Ray Charles’s eldest child, who was born in 1949.</p><h3>Ray Charles Robinson Jr.</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cms.afrotech.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RayCharlesJR-1200x675.jpg><p>The eldest son of Ray Charles was born in 1955 and has quite a distinguished career in the entertainment industry. He was the co-producer of the “Ray” biopic, and the co-executive producer of “Ray Charles: 50 Years of Music.” He also wrote a book called “You Don’t Know Me,” about his father and his life, and <a href=#>his bio</a> says he’s “committed to helping those in need in his community, especially those struggling with addiction.”</p><h3>David Robinson</h3><p>Born in 1958, David Robinson has very vivid memories of his father. In 2020, he shared some of his favorite ones with <a href=#>Closer Magazine.</a> He also recalled his father’s independence.</p><p>“I think that was a driving force in his life,” he said. “It had to be, because of his discipline and what he was able to do.”</p><h3>Charles Wayne Hendricks</h3><h3>Dr. Robert F.
